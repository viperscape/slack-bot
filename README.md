# slack-bot

slack.com irc notifications
This is just example code or starter for you. I like slack.com notifications so thought this was a nice idea

Head over to slack.com and build a team and add channel with api integration, use this resulting token for your own notifications

## Installation

clone repo, lein run

## Options

mention bot or private message with "#full-uri-to-slack-channel"
ex: slack-bot, #https://greathonu.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=1234
