# slack-bot

``` slack.com irc notifications ```

This is just example code or starter for you. I like slack.com notifications so thought this was a nice idea

Head over to slack.com and build a team and add channel with api integration, use this resulting token for your own notifications. Run example code and specify each irc channel you want slack-bot to sit in and listen

## Installation

1. clone repo
2. lein run clojure manjaro

## Options

Make sure you register your irc nick with a slack token, so mention the bot or private message with "#full-uri-to-slack-channel"

ex: slack-bot, #https://greathonu.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=1234
